.config
=======

My configuration files for Unix.

##Main configs

Syntax/color configuration in bash_profile for iTerm/Terminal. Put the file in the home directory.
Reload terminal by "$ . ~/.bash_profile"

Be sure to edit the path variable to match your system!


##Vim configs

Configuration for vim to add syntax coloring, code completion, mouse support. Put ".vim" directory and ".vimrc" 
file in home directory.

(Mouse integration only in iTerm or PuTTY, not Terminal)
